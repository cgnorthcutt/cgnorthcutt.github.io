## Research Manifesto

* Use machine learning to augment human learning, especially for social good.
* Understand and learn in spite of uncertainty and noise in labeled datasets.

While these two ideas appear disparate, they are mutually dependent. Humans often have false notions about the world and encounter misinformation, yet we still learn well in noisy environments. Augmenting human learning with machine learning necessitates a deeper understanding of learning in noisy environments. Across healthcare, agriculture, politics, economics, transportation... our future as a species relies on an increasing synergy between machine learning and human learning: it is paramount that we have the tools to deal with real-world uncertainty, while maintaining the foresight to focus our advances in machine intelligence towards social good.

## The Gift of Education

When you educate a person, you empower them within their community, and when you empower people socially, you give them hope, purpose, opportunity, and most importantly, you give them freedom.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I experienced a glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, then summer programs, then small scholarships, then bigger scholarships, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources -- this underlies my motivation to pursue research that democratizes education. 

To this end, I develop robust machine learning algorithms to enable open learning, i.e. to make advanced education more accessible. I work with edX student data to (1) infer user-intent across terabytes of noisy, massive interaction datasets and (2) implement prediction, inference, and detection algorithms distributed across 400+ MITx and HarvardX open online courses. For example, I ensure the legitimacy of online course certificates via cheating detection algorithms and with the help of exceptional colleagues, have demonstrated how machine learning can transform human learning with accurate proficiency estimation and diversification of comment rankings in discussion forums.

## Life Mantras

{:start="1"}
    1. Do work that empowers people, especially the underpriveledged.
    2. The "smarter" person is just the one who studied more than you.
    3. Work seriously, but don't take yourself too seriously 😉

* **People**
{:start="4"}
    4. Spend your time with people you admire.
    5. Be curious, not judgemental.
    6. Loosen your grip. Nothing good gets away.
    7. The worst unsolved problem on Earth is bad parenting.

## Long biography


## About

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT, where I was fortunate to work with [Isaac Chuang](https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/chuang_isaac.html). Before that, I was awarded the [MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award](http://18.9.44.118/institute-awards/2015-2016-awards/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science) for my masters thesis work at MIT, the [NSF Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), and the [MITx Digital Learning Research Fellowship](https://odl.mit.edu/about/our-team/curtis-northcutt). I also taught as a TA for MIT's graduate machine learning course (6.867). Before that, I graduated as [valedictorian](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/founders-medalists/) from Vanderbilt University (2009-2013) where I majored in mathematics and computer science and was awarded the [Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship](http://act.org/goldwater/sch-2012.html).

My [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=awRyuUYAAAAJ&hl) spans the theory and applications of artificial intelligence including [uncertainty quantification](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/confident-learning) and [augmenting human capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05699). I invented [confident learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.00068.pdf) and [cleanlab (1.5k+ stars on GitHub)](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab), the Python package for machine learning with noisy labels and finding label errors in datasets. Before that, I created the [CAMEO cheating detection system](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat) used to validate certificates in MITx and HarvardX online course teams. I am grateful to have worked at many of the world's leading AI research groups, including Google AI, Oculus Research, Facebook AI Research, Amazon AI, Microsoft Research, NASA, MIT, and Harvard.

Working with [Richard Newcombe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MhowvPkAAAAJ&hl=fr), I created the first augmented reality dataset for multi-person conversational AI, [EgoCom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoCom-Dataset). Our associated [T-PAMI paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9200754) uses the EgoCom dataset to [predict turn-taking](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoCom-Dataset/tree/main/paper_experiments_work_log/turntaking) in conversations.

With friends from Harvard and MIT, I co-founded [ChipBrain](https://chipbrain.com/), an empathy AI company building digital brains. As CTO of ChipBrain, I led our mission to build emotionally intelligent AI that helps anyone build better relationships and connect with their audience more deeply. I envisioned a world where people from different backgrounds can empathize with one another, whether it's solving an argument with a partner, selling a product to a customer, or asking for time off from your boss. **I resigned from ChipBrain in late 2021 to focus full-time on Cleanlab[https://cleanlab.ai/].**

In my spare time, I help researchers [build affordable state-of-the-art deep learning machines](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/the-best-4-gpu-deep-learning-rig) and enjoy competitive mountaineering, hiking, and cycling.
