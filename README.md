## Bio in third person

[Curtis Northcutt](curtisnorthcutt.com) is a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at MIT, an [NSF Fellow](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), and an [MITx Digital Learning Research Fellow](https://odl.mit.edu/about/our-team/curtis-northcutt) working under the supervision of [Isaac Chuang](http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/chuang_isaac.html). His work spans **robust algorithms for classification with mislabeled training data and noise estimation, noisy learning, weak supervision, semi-supervised learning, cheating detection, and online education**. Curtis has won numerous awards, including the [MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-celebrates-2015-2016-award-winners), an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), the[Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship](http://act.org/goldwater/sch-2012.html), and the [Vanderbilt Founderâ€™s Medal](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/founders-medalists/) (Valedictorian). Curtis created and is responsible for the [cheating detection system](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat) used by MITx and HarvardX online course teams, particularly the MIT MicroMasters courses. At MIT, Curtis is a teaching assistant for 6.867, a (300+ students) graduate machine learning course. He is lucky to have had the opporunity to work or intern at Amazon Research, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Microsoft Research (MSR) India, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Microsoft, NASA, General Electric, and a National Science Foundation REU including collaborations with MIT, Harvard, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, and the University of Kentucky.

## The Gift of Education

Growing up in rural Kentucky, my peers and I encountered a social glass ceiling of limited human expertise and monetary resources, in juxtaposition with the educational resources of students in more prosperous areas. Fueled by this experience, I am motivated to pursue research that mitigates this glass ceiling for all students. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources. When you educate a person, you empower them within their community, and when you empower people within their communities, you give them hope, purpose, opportunity, and most importantly, you give them freedom.

I develop robust machine learning algorithms to enable open learning, i.e. to make advanced education more accessible. We like to call the achievement of such a vision the "democratization of education." I work with edX student data to (1) infer user-intent across terabytes of noisy, massive interaction datasets and (2) implement prediction, inference, and detection algorithms distributed across 400+ MITx and HarvardX open online courses. Specifically, I invented and manage the CAMEO cheating detection system used by MITx and HarvardX to validate and determine the legitimacy of online course certificates, particularly for the MicroMasters courses. With the help of exceptional colleagues, we've also demonstrated how machine learning can transform human learning with accurate proficiency estimation and the diversification of comment rankings in discussion forums.

## Life Mantras

* Transcend obstacles you weren't even supposed to know existed.
* Make a global impact. Do work that improve's the human condition on a global scale.
* Optimize every aspect of your health (social, intellectual, physical, spiritual, religious)
* Push the boundaries of what is reasonable. In doing so, you will achieve the unreasonable.
* Never stop expanding your viewpoint, welcome every new experience.
