## About (in third person)

Curtis G. Northcutt is a grad student in Computer Science at MIT, supported by [a NSF Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList) and a [MITx Digital Learning Research Fellowship](https://odl.mit.edu/about/our-team/curtis-northcutt) working with [Isaac Chuang](http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/chuang_isaac.html). His work focuses on two goals: (1) characterizing and fixing (or learning in spite of) label errors in machine learning datasets, (2) using artificial intelligence to enable human intelligence. To this end, Curtis invented *confident learning*, a family of theory and algorithms for learning with label errors, and created [cleanlab](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab), a Python package using confident learning to find label errors in datasets, characterize label noise, and learn with noisy labels. Other fields related to Curtis's work are weak supervision, semi-supervised learning, and online education.

Curtis has been fortunate to receive the [MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-celebrates-2015-2016-award-winners), an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), the [Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship](http://act.org/goldwater/sch-2012.html), and the [Vanderbilt Founderâ€™s Medal](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/founders-medalists/) (Valedictorian). Curtis created and manages the [cheating detection system](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat) used by MITx and HarvardX online course teams, particularly the MIT MicroMasters courses. While at MIT, he TA'd 6.867, a large graduate machine learning course.

## Research Focii/Goals

* The use of artificial intelligence to improve human intelligence.
* Fixing (or learning in spite of) label errors, particularly in ML benchmark datasets.
* Efforts that challenge current paradigms in machine learning and encourage rigor.
* Applications of AI and ML for social good.

 as well as academic collaborations and visiting research with MIT, Harvard, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, and the University of Kentucky. Details [here](/resources/pdf/cv.pdf).

## The Gift of Education

When you educate a person, you empower them within their community, and when you empower people socially, you give them hope, purpose, opportunity, and most importantly, you give them freedom.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I experienced a glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, then summer programs, then small scholarships, then bigger scholarships, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources -- this underlies my motivation to pursue research that democratizes education. 

To this end, I develop robust machine learning algorithms to enable open learning, i.e. to make advanced education more accessible. I work with edX student data to (1) infer user-intent across terabytes of noisy, massive interaction datasets and (2) implement prediction, inference, and detection algorithms distributed across 400+ MITx and HarvardX open online courses. For example, I ensure the legitimacy of online course certificates via cheating detection algorithsm and with the help of exceptional colleagues, have demonstrated how machine learning can transform human learning with accurate proficiency estimation and diversification of comment rankings in discussion forums.

## Life Mantras

* Make a global impact. Do work that improves the human condition on a global scale.
* Optimize every aspect of your health (social, intellectual, physical, spiritual, religious)
* Push the boundaries of what is reasonable to achieve the unreasonable.
* Never stop expanding your viewpoint, welcome every new experience.
* Work seriously, but don't take yourself too seriously ðŸ˜‰

### When asked if I like rap, I always recommend [PomDP the PhD rapper](http://pomdp.productions).
