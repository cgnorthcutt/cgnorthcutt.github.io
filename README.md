## About

I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in EECS at MIT advised by [Isaac Chuang](https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/chuang_isaac.html), and supported by an [NSF Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList) and a [MITx Digital Learning Research Fellowship](https://odl.mit.edu/about/our-team/curtis-northcutt).

My research focuses on two goals: (1) [dataset uncertainty estimation](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/confident-learning), (2) the synergy of [artificial intelligence to augment human intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05699). To this end, I established [confident learning](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/confident-learning) with co-authors [Lu Jiang, a family of theory and algorithms for characterizing, finding, and learning with label errors in datasets, and [cleanlab](https://github.com/cgnorthcutt/cleanlab), the official Python framework for machine learning and deep learning with noisy labels in datasets.
For an overview of my published research, please visit [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=awRyuUYAAAAJ&hl).

In addition to my [MIT research](/md/research.html), I am [Chief AI Scientist](https://www.anoto.com/anoto-announces-the-establishment-of-kait-solutions-inc-a-us-subsidiary-for-its-education-software/) at [Knowledge AI](https://kaitsolutions.com/), the principal author of the [L7 machine learning blog](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/), [PomDP the PhD rapper](https://www.phdrapper.com/), and a contingent research scientist at [Oculus Research](https://www.oculus.com/research/?locale=en_US). 

In my spare time, I help researchers [build affordable state-of-the-art deep learning machines](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/the-best-4-gpu-deep-learning-rig) and enjoy competitive mountaineering, hiking, and cycling.

Some awards I've received include the [MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-celebrates-2015-2016-award-winners), the [NSF GRFP Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), the [Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship](http://act.org/goldwater/sch-2012.html), and the [Vanderbilt Founderâ€™s Medal](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/founders-medalists/) (Valedictorian). Curtis created and manages the [cheating detection system](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat) used by MITx and HarvardX online course teams, particularly in [MicroMasters](https://micromasters.mit.edu/) courses. While at MIT, I TA'd 6.867, a large graduate machine learning course.

## Research Manifesto

## The Gift of Education

When you educate a person, you empower them within their community, and when you empower people socially, you give them hope, purpose, opportunity, and most importantly, you give them freedom.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I experienced a glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, then summer programs, then small scholarships, then bigger scholarships, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources -- this underlies my motivation to pursue research that democratizes education. 

To this end, I develop robust machine learning algorithms to enable open learning, i.e. to make advanced education more accessible. I work with edX student data to (1) infer user-intent across terabytes of noisy, massive interaction datasets and (2) implement prediction, inference, and detection algorithms distributed across 400+ MITx and HarvardX open online courses. For example, I ensure the legitimacy of online course certificates via cheating detection algorithms and with the help of exceptional colleagues, have demonstrated how machine learning can transform human learning with accurate proficiency estimation and diversification of comment rankings in discussion forums.

## Life Mantras

* Make a global impact. Do work that improves the human condition on a global scale.
* Optimize every aspect of your health (social, intellectual, physical, spiritual, religious)
* Push the boundaries of what is reasonable to achieve the unreasonable.
* Never stop expanding your viewpoint, welcome every new experience.
* Work seriously, but don't take yourself too seriously ðŸ˜‰

When asked if I like rap, I recommend [PomDP the PhD rapper](https://phdrapper.com).
