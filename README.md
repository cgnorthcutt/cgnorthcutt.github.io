## About 

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at MIT, an [NSF Fellow](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), and an [MITx Digital Learning Research Fellow](https://odl.mit.edu/about/our-team/curtis-northcutt) working under the supervision of [Isaac Chuang](http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/chuang_isaac.html). My work spans **robust algorithms for classification with mislabeled training data and noise estimation, noisy learning, weak supervision, semi-supervised learning, cheating detection, and online education**. Some of my awards are the [MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/announcements/eecs-celebrates-2015-2016-award-winners), an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList), the [Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship](http://act.org/goldwater/sch-2012.html), and the [Vanderbilt Founderâ€™s Medal](http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2013/05/founders-medalists/) (Valedictorian). I created and am responsible for the [cheating detection system](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/08/26/harvard-mit-researchers-find-mooc-learners-using-multiple-accounts-cheat) used by MITx and HarvardX online course teams, particularly the MIT MicroMasters courses. I am a teaching assistant for 6.867, a (300+ students) graduate machine learning course at MIT. I am very fortunate to have had the opportunities to work or intern at Amazon Research, Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Microsoft Research (MSR) India, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Microsoft, NASA, General Electric, and a National Science Foundation REU including collaborations with MIT, Harvard, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, and the University of Kentucky.

## The Gift of Education

When you educate a person, you empower them within their community, and when you empower people socially, you give them hope, purpose, opportunity, and most importantly, you give them freedom.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I felt the glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, summer programs, small scholarships, then bigger scholarhsips, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources -- this underlies my motivation to pursue research that promotes a democritization of education. 

To this end, I develop robust machine learning algorithms to enable open learning, i.e. to make advanced education more accessible. We like to call the achievement of such a vision the "democratization of education." I work with edX student data to (1) infer user-intent across terabytes of noisy, massive interaction datasets and (2) implement prediction, inference, and detection algorithms distributed across 400+ MITx and HarvardX open online courses. Specifically, I invented and manage the CAMEO cheating detection system used by MITx and HarvardX to validate and determine the legitimacy of online course certificates, particularly for the MicroMasters courses. With the help of exceptional colleagues, we've also demonstrated how machine learning can transform human learning with accurate proficiency estimation and the diversification of comment rankings in discussion forums.

## Life Mantras

* Make a global impact. Do work that improve's the human condition on a global scale.
* Optimize every aspect of your health (social, intellectual, physical, spiritual, religious)
* Push the boundaries of what is reasonable to achieve the unreasonable.
* Never stop expanding your viewpoint, welcome every new experience.
* Work seriously, but don't take yourself too seriously.
